In the age of digital transformation, one of the pressing challenges faced by airlines, passengers, and aviation authorities is the unpredictability 
of flight operations due to delays, weather conditions, and operational inefficiencies. This project, Flight Status Prediction and Analysis, was born out 
of a desire to harness data science and machine learning to bring more transparency and foresight into air travel.

The project focuses on predicting the status of a flight — whether it will be on time, delayed, or cancelled — using a 
supervised machine learning pipeline. Drawing from a rich dataset containing flight-level data, including scheduled and 
actual departure times, delays, air traffic, and weather features, this project models the factors influencing flight punctuality
and seeks to uncover patterns that are otherwise buried in raw airline logs.

The core of the analysis begins with meticulous data cleaning and feature engineering. Missing values were systematically addressed, 
categorical features were encoded, and time variables were converted into meaningful components (e.g., day of week, hour of departure). 
The data was then split into training and testing subsets to ensure robust model evaluation.

I explored several classification models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and XGBoost. Through rigorous model tuning and evaluation, 
XGBoost emerged as the most performant model, with the highest accuracy and F1-score. This model is particularly effective in handling imbalanced data 
and nonlinear relationships, making it well-suited to the unpredictable nature of flight statuses.

Beyond prediction, the project offers insights through visualizations that highlight the impact of factors such as departure hour, airline carrier, 
and origin airport on flight delays. These insights are not only valuable from an operational standpoint but also help identify policy recommendations 
or improvement areas for aviation stakeholders.What sets this project apart is its blend of technical rigor and real-world applicability. It is not just 
about building a model — it's about creating a solution that could potentially assist airlines in scheduling more efficiently or help passengers better plan 
their journeys. As someone passionate about using machine learning to solve tangible problems, this project reflects my ability to combine data engineering, 
statistical modeling, and storytelling to deliver actionable insights.Whether you're an airline executive looking to minimize disruptions, a data scientist 
evaluating machine learning applications, or a recruiter looking for a candidate who brings both vision and execution, this project is a demonstration of my 
commitment to using data science to drive smarter, more human-centric decisions.
